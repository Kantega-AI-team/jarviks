# Client - J.A.R.V.I.K.S Frontend

This is the frontend part of the J.A.R.V.I.K.S project.

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript**: Because its awesome
- **React**: 
- **Redux Toolkit**:
- **React Speech Kit**: To accomodate capturing speech from the app, sending it to the Whisper API
- **Socket.io Client**: Used to communicate with the server.

## Dragons
React speech kit has not been updated in a while and has conflicting peer-dependencies with other packages in the application. 
The current workaround is to use the --legacy-peer-deps flag when installing packages.
